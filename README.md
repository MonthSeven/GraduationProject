# IPv6 Neighbor Discovery for Prefix and Service Discovery in Vehicular Networks
##### GraduationProject

I will proposes an extension of IPv6 neighbor
discovery (ND) for rapid network prefix and service discovery in
vehicular networks. It is assumed that a vehicle as a moving network
(MN) or a road-side unit (RSU) as a fixed network (FN) has
an external network interface, and hosts in an MN periodically
announce their services to their local DNS Server called recursive
DNS server (RDNSS) of the MN. We define new options for prefix
and service discovery in IPv6 ND through which an MN or an
FN can fast exchange prefix and service information by sending
the neighbor solicitation (NS) and neighbor advertisement (NA)
messages containing a senderâ€™s prefix and service information.
Through theoretical analysis comparing our proposed method
with conventional methods separating prefix discovery and service
discovery, our approach can reduce the delay of the prefix
and service discovery to provide better intelligent transportation
services (e.g., cooperative adaptive cruise control for collision
avoidance) in vehicular environment.
